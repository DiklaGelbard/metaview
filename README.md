# metaview
Metaview is a proof-of-concept (POC) for an interactive tool designed for annotating cell types on Single Cell RNAseq data. As an M.Sc student in Ido Amit's Lab, I developed this Shiny App with the aim of simplifying and ensuring the reproducibility of the annotation process.
The application allows users to adjust gene markers and their threshold values for specific cell types to create a colorized table, which serves as a set of guidelines for annotating cell types on a particular dataset.
I believed that the widespread use of these colorized tables would aid in the development of an effective classifier for scRNAseq data.
